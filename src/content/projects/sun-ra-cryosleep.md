## Overview

Exploration of fluid and sediment to sonically communicate ritual and passage.

## Conceptual Framework

An investigation of the transpiration of Black bodies across space-time and its depiction (often involving water/fluid), meaning, and relevance within both historical fact (Atlantic Slave Trade) and science-fiction/fantasy narratives.

## Technical Approach

A speculative ritual and sonic sculpture of submerging artifacts in water. Their reactions of dissolving and motion of floating are sonified via hydrophones and mixed with samples of NASA Data Sonifications.

## The Question

The persona of Sun Ra (Jazz band leader and musician) metaphorically and ritualistically hailed from Saturn (as seen in *Space is the Place*). So, on his journey to Earth, did he fear entering cryosleep?
